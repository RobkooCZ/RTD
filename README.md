# RTD - Beta Branch
- working on updates on this branch before it gets pushed to production (main)

## Differences from the Main branch
- Tower placed on one connected client shows up on others and work
- No wave logic
- Differences in files and code structure, here it's more organized and not all in one file
- Backend

## Currently working on:
- Simple multiplayer (for example one client places a tower and the other one sees it)
