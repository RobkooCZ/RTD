# RTD - Beta Branch
- working on updates on this branch before it gets pushed to production (main)
- working on Alpha 0.4 currently

## Differences from the Main branch 
- Tower placed on one connected client shows up on others and work
- Upgrades on one client's towers shows up and WORKS on other clients
- You can't click on and upgrade or sell towers that aren't yours
- Made the towers that aren't yours darker on the map to differentiate your and other peoples' towers
- No wave logic
- Differences in files and code structure, here it's more organized and not all in one file
- Added checks so you have to input something to the field before getting into a lobby
- Added options to choose what you want to play in multiplayer
- Simple lobby system where you can join a lobby using lobby id, and you see a player list. very primitive, WIP!!!!!!!!!!

## Currently working on:
- Simple multiplayer
