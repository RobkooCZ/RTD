# RTD - Beta Branch
- working on updates on this branch before it gets pushed to production (main)
- working on Alpha 0.4 currently

## Differences from the Main branch 
- Tower placed on one connected client shows up on others and work
- Upgrades on one client's towers shows up and WORKS on other clients
- You can't click on and upgrade or sell towers that aren't yours
- Made the towers that aren't yours darker on the map to differentiate your and other peoples' towers
- No wave logic
- Differences in files and code structure, here it's more organized and not all in one file
- Backend

## Currently working on:
- Simple multiplayer
